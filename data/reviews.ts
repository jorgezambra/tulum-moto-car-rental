    comment: "Everything was great and highly recommended. They brought the scooter to the hotel door. It was in very good condition, and they'll return the deposit you leave without any problem. Don't worry about that. They don't deceive you at any point; on the contrary, they guide you so you can get there with ease. I recommend it 100%.",
